## Best Practices for Two-Scene Videos

### 1. The 80% Repetition Rule

When writing Scene 2 prompts, **repeat at least 80%** of Scene 1's character description:

**Scene 1:**
```
A Thai woman with Southeast Asian features, warm skin tone, black hair in a ponytail,
wearing a white top, holding product X...
```

**Scene 2 (80% repetition):**
```
Continue: The SAME Thai woman with Southeast Asian features, warm skin tone,
black hair in a ponytail, wearing the SAME white top,
now [NEW ACTION] with product X...
```

### 2. Reference Image Strategy

For critical consistency, save key frames as assets:

1. **After Scene 1 generation:** Save the final frame
2. **Use in Scene 2:** Upload as reference image (Frames-to-Video method)
3. **Result:** Guaranteed visual continuity

### 3. Keyword Bridges

Use transition keywords to connect scenes:

| Scene 1 End | Scene 2 Start |
|-------------|---------------|
| "...holding product" | "Continue: same character, now using..." |
| "...looking at mirror" | "Continue: same reflection, now smiling..." |
| "...package on table" | "Continue: package opened, now..." |
| "...walking toward..." | "Continue: arrived at..." |

### 4. Color Consistency

Specify colors explicitly in BOTH scenes:

**Scene 1:**
```
...wearing a forest green #228B22 jacket...
```

**Scene 2:**
```
...wearing the SAME forest green #228B22 jacket...
```

### 5. Camera Style Continuity

Maintain camera movement across scenes:

| Scene 1 Camera | Scene 2 Camera |
|----------------|----------------|
| Handheld, subtle movement | Handheld, subtle movement (same energy) |
| Slow, cinematic | Slow, cinematic (same pace) |
| Dynamic, energetic | Dynamic, energetic (same vibe) |

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Character looks different between scenes

**Solution 1:** Increase prompt detail
```
Add: skin tone, hair texture, eye color, height, build, distinctive features
```

**Solution 2:** Use Frames-to-Video method
```
Save Scene 1 final frame → Use as starting frame for Scene 2
```

**Solution 3:** Limit to 2 scenes maximum
```
More scenes = more quality degradation
```

### Issue: Lighting doesn't match

**Solution:** Specify lighting in BOTH scenes
```
Scene 1: "soft natural morning light from left window"
Scene 2: "SAME soft natural morning light, now with warm golden hour glow"
```

### Issue: Transition feels abrupt

**Solution:** Use bridging action
```
Scene 1 ends: "...walking toward bathroom mirror"
Scene 2 starts: "Continue: same character, now arrived at mirror..."
```
